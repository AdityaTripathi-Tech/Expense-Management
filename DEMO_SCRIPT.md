## 🤔 Judge Q&A Preparation

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do you handle API rate limits?**
**A:** "We implement exponential backoff retry logic (1s, 2s, 4s) and comprehensive caching. If APIs are unavailable, we fall back to cached data, then local fixtures, and finally mark items for manual review."

**Q: What happens if currency conversion fails?**
**A:** "The expense is marked as 'conversion_pending' and flagged for admin review. Users are notified, and the system continues to function with manual intervention available."

**Q: How accurate is the OCR?**
**A:** "We use confidence scoring with configurable thresholds (default 0.6). Low-confidence results are flagged for user verification. We support both Tesseract and Google Vision APIs."

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
**A:** "Absolutely. We have comprehensive error handling, extensive test coverage, CI/CD pipeline, Docker deployment, and real-world fallback scenarios tested."

### Business Questions

**Q: How does this save time for employees?**
**A:** "OCR auto-fills expense details, currency conversion is automatic, and the approval workflow is streamlined. Employees spend less time on data entry and more time on productive work."

**Q: What about compliance and audit trails?**
**A:** "Every action is logged with timestamps, user tracking, and approval chains. Currency conversions include source URLs and rates for audit purposes."

**Q: How scalable is this solution?**
**A:** "Built on Odoo's enterprise framework with proper indexing, caching, and service architecture. Handles multi-company, multi-currency scenarios out of the box."

### Integration Questions

**Q: Can this integrate with existing accounting systems?**
**A:** "Yes, built on Odoo's accounting framework with standard journal entries. Easy integration with external systems via REST APIs."

**Q: What about mobile access?**
**A:** "Fully responsive web interface works on all devices. Can be extended with Odoo's mobile app or custom PWA."

## 🚨 Troubleshooting During Demo

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

**Issue: Currency conversion not working**
```bash
# Quick fix: Enable stubs
export USE_API_STUBS=True
docker-compose restart odoo
```

**Issue: OCR not processing**
```bash
# Check if Tesseract is installed
docker-compose exec odoo tesseract --version
# Fallback: Use manual entry to show workflow
```

**Issue: Approval workflow stuck**
```bash
# Use demo approve button (admin only)
# Navigate to expense → Click "Demo: Approve All"
```

### Backup Demo Data
